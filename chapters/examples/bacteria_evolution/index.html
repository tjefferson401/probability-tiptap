<center><h1>Bacteria Evolution</h1></center>
<hr/>

<p>A wonderful property of modern life is that we have anti-biotics to kill bacterial infections. However, we only have a fixed number of anti-biotic medicines, and bacteria are evolving to become resistent to our anti-biotics. In this example we are going to use probability to understand evolution of anti-biotic resistence in bacteria.</p>


<p>Imagine you have a population of 1 million infectious bacteria in your gut, 10% of which have a mutation that makes them
slightly more resistant to anti-biotics. You take a course of anti-biotics. The probability that bacteria with the
mutation survives is 20%. The probability that bacteria without the mutation survives is 1%.</p>


<p>What is the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium
survives the anti-biotics?</p>

<p>
<div class="bordered">
	Let $E$ be the event that our bacterium survives. Let $M$ be the event that a bacteria has the mutation. By the <a href="{{pathToLang}}en/part1/law_total">Law of Total Probability</a> (LOTP):
	$$
	\begin{align}
	\p(E) 
		&= \p(E \and M) + \p(E \and M\c)
			&& \text{LOTP} \\ 
		&= \p(E | M)\p(M) + \p(E | M\c)\p(M\c)
			&& \text{Chain Rule} \\ 	
		&= 0.20 \cdot 0.10 + 0.01 \cdot 0.90 
			&& \text{Substituting} \\ 
		&= 0.029
	\end{align}
	$$
</div>
</p>

<p>What is the probability that a surviving bacterium has the mutation?</p>

<p>
<div class="bordered">
	Using the same events in the last section, this question is asking for $\p(M | E)$. We aren't giving the conditional probability in that direction, instead we know $P(E|M)$. Such situations call for <a href="{{pathToLang}}en/part1/bayes_theorem">Bayes' Theorem</a>:
	$$
	\begin{align}
	\p(M | E) 
		&=  \frac{\p(E|M)\p(M)}{\p(E)} 
			&& \text{Bayes} \\
		&=  \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.10}{\p(E)} 
			&& \text{Given} \\
		&=  \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.10}{0.029} 
			&& \text{Calculated} \\
		&\approx  0.69
	\end{align}
	$$
</div>
</p>

<p>After the course of anti-biotics, 69% of bacteria have the mutation, up from 10% before. If this population is allowed to reproduce you will have a much more resistent set of bacteria!
