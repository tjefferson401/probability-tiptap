<p>The length of a menstrual cycle is, naturally, a random variable. Let X represent the length of a menstrual
cycle: the number of days, as a continuous value, between the first moment of one period to the first moment
of the next, for a given person. X is parameterized by $\alpha$ and $\beta$ with probability density function:</p>

$$
f(X=x) = \beta \cdot(x - \alpha)^{\beta - 1} \cdot e^{-(x - \alpha)^2}
$$

Where $e$ is the natural base.
