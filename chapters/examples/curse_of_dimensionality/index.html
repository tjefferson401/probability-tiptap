<center><h1>Curse of Dimensionality</h1></center>
<hr/>


<p>In machine learning, like many fields of computer science, often involves high dimensional points, and high dimension spaces have some surprising probabilistic properties. 

<p>A random <i>value</i> $X_i$ is a Uni(0, 1).<br/>
A random <i>point</i> of dimension $d$ is a list of $d$ random values: $[X_1 \dots X_d]$.

<p> A random <i>value</i> $X_i$ is close to an edge if $X_i$ is less than 0.01 <b>or</b> $X_i$ is greater than 0.99. What is the probability that a random value is close to an edge?</p>
<p><div class="bordered">Let $E$ be the event that a random value is close to an edge.
 $P(E) = P(X_i < 0.01) + P(X_i > 0.99) = 0.02$
</div></p>

<p>A random <i>point</i> $[X_1, X_2, X_3]$ of dimension $3$ is close to an edge if <i>any</i> of its values are close to an edge. What is the probability that a $3$ dimensional point is close to an edge?</p>

<p><div class="bordered">The event is equivalent to the complement of none of the dimensions of the 
 point is close to an edge, which is: 
 $1 - (1 - P(E))^3 = 1 - 0.98^3 \approx 0.058$
</div></p>

<p>A random <i>point</i> $[X_1, \dots X_{100}]$ of dimension $100$ is close to an edge if <i>any</i> of its values are close to an edge. What is the probability that a 100 dimensional point is close to an edge?</p>

<p><div class="bordered">Similarly, it is: 
 $1 - (1 - P(E))^{100} = 1 - 0.98^{100} \approx 0.867$
</div>

There are many other phenomena of high dimensional points: such as, the euclidean distance between points starts to converge.
