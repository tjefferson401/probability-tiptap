 <center><h1>Bayes' Theorem</h1></center>
<hr/>

<p>Bayes' Theorem is one of the most ubiquitous results in probability for computer scientists. In a nutshell, Bayes' theorem  provides a way to convert a conditional probability from one direction, say $\p(E|F)$, to the other direction, $\p(F|E)$.</p> 

<p>Bayes' theorem is a mathematical identity which we can
derive ourselves. Start with the definition of conditional probability and then expand the $\and$ term using the chain rule:


$$
\begin{align}
\p(F|E) 
&= \frac{\p(F \and E)}{\p(E)} && \text{Def of }
\href{ {{pathToLang}}part1/cond_prob/}{\text{conditional probability}}

  \\
&= \frac{\p(E | F) \cdot \p(F)}{\p(E)} && \text{Substitute the }
\href{ {{pathToLang}}part1/cond_prob/#chain_rule}{\text{chain rule}} \text{ for $\p(F \and E)$}
\end{align}
$$

<p>
This theorem makes no assumptions about $E$ or $F$ so it will apply for any two events. Bayes' theorem  is exceptionally useful because it turns out to be the ubiquitous way to answer the question: "how can I update a belief about something,  which is not directly observable, given evidence." This is for good reason. For many "noisy" measurements it is straightforward to estimate the probability of the noisy observation given the true state of the world. However, what you would really like to know is the conditional probability the other way around: what is the probability of the true state of the world given evidence.  There are countless real world situations that fit this situation:

	<b>Example 1: Medical tests</b><br/>
<i>What you want to know:</i> Probability of a disease given a test result<br/>
<i>What is easy to know:</i> Probability of a test result given the true state of disease<br/>
<i>Causality:</i> We believe that diseases influences test results
</p>

<p>
	<b>Example 2: Student ability</b><br/>
<i>What you want to know:</i> Student knowledge of a subject given their answers<br/>
<i>What is easy to know:</i> Likelihood of answers given a student's knowledge of a subject<br/>
<i>Causality:</i> We believe that ability influences answers 
</p>

<p>
	<b>Example 3: Cell phone location</b><br/>
<i>What you want to know:</i> Where is a cell phone, given noisy measure of distance to tower<br/>
<i>What is easy to know:</i> Error in noisy measure, given the true distance to tower<br/>
<i>Causality:</i> We believe that cell phone location influences distance measure
</div>
</p>


<p>
	There is a pattern here: in each example we care about knowing some unobservable -- or hard to observe -- state of the world. This state of the world "causes" some easy-to-observe evidence. For example: having the flu (something we would like to know) <b><i>causes</i></b> a fever (something we can easily observe), not the other way around. We often call the unobservable state the "belief" and the observable state the "evidence". For that reason lets rename the events! Lets call the unobservable thing we want to know $B$ for belief. Lets call the thing we have evidence of $E$ for evidence. This makes it clear that Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate an updated belief given evidence: $\p(B | E)$

	<b><i>Definition</i></b>: Bayes' Theorem <br/>

	<p> The most common form of Bayes' Theorem is 
		<b>Bayes' Theorem Classic</b>:
		$$
		\p(B|E) = \frac{\p(E | B) \cdot \p(B)}{\p(E)} 
		$$
	</p>

	<p>There are names for the different terms in the Bayes' Rule formula. The term $\p(B|E)$  is often called the
"posterior": it is your updated belief of $B$ after you take into account evidence $E$. The term $\p(B)$ is often called the "prior": it was your belief before seeing any evidence. The term $\p(E|B)$ is called the update and $\p(E)$ is
often called the normalization constant.</p>

<p>There are several techniques for handling the case where the denominator is not known. One technique is to use the law of total probability to expand out the term, resulting in another formula, called <b>Bayes' Theorem with Law of Total Probability</b>:
$$
\p(B|E) = \frac{\p(E | B) \cdot \p(B)}{\p(E|B)\cdot \p(B) + \p(E|B\c) \cdot \p(B\c)} 
$$
</p>
Recall the law of total probability which is responsible for our new denominator:
$$
\begin{align}
\p(E) = \p(E|B)\cdot \p(B) + \p(E|B\c) \cdot \p(B\c)
\end{align}
$$
</div>
</p>

<p>A common scenario for applying the Bayes' Rule formula is when you want to know the probability of
something “unobservable” given an “observed” event! For example, you want to know the probability that a
student understands a concept, given that you observed them solving a particular problem. It turns out it is
much easier to first estimate the probability that a student can solve a problem given that they understand the
concept and then to apply Bayes' Theorem. Intuitively, you can think about this as updating a belief given
evidence.</p>

<h2>Bayes' Theorem Applied</h2>

<p>Sometimes the (correct) results from Bayes' Theorem can be counter intuitive. Here we work through a classic result: Bayes' applied to medical tests. We show a dynamic solution and present a visualization for understanding what is happening.</p>

	<h2>Bayes with the General Law of Total Probability</h2>

	<p>A classic challenge when applying Bayes' theorem is to calculate the probability of the normalization constant $\p(E)$ in the denominator of Bayes' Theorem. One common strategy for calculating this probability is to use the law of total probability. Our expanded version of Bayes' Theorem uses the simple version of the total law of probability: $\p(E) = \p(E|F)\p(F) + \p(E|F^c)
	\p(F^c)$. Sometimes you will want the more expanded version of the <a href="{{pathToLang}}part1/law_total">law of total probability</a>: $\p(E) = \sum_i\p(E|B_i)\p(B_i)$. Recall that this only works if the events $B_i$ are mutually exclusive and cover the sample space.
	</p>
	<p>For example say we are trying to track a phone which could be in any one of $n$ discrete
locations and we have prior beliefs $\p(B_1) \dots \p(B_n)$ as to whether the phone is in location $B_i$. Now we gain
some evidence (such as a particular signal strength from a particular cell tower) that we call $E$ and we need
to update all of our probabilities to be $\p(B_i
|E)$. We should use Bayes' Theorem!</p>

<p>The probability of the observation, assuming that the the phone is in location $B_i$, $\p(E|B_i)$, is something that
can be given to you by an expert. In this case the probability of getting a particular signal strength given a
location $B_i$ will be determined by the distance between the cell tower and location $B_i$
.</p>
<p>Since we are assuming that the phone must be in <i>exactly</i> one of the locations, we can find the probability of
any of the event $B_i$ given $E$ by first applying Bayes' Theorem and then applying the general version of the law of
total probability:</p>
$$
\begin{align}
\p(B_i | E) &= \frac{\p(E|B_i) \cdot \p(B_i)}{\p(E)}
&& \text{Bayes Theorem. What to do about $\p(E)$?} \\
 &= \frac{\p(E|B_i) \cdot \p(B_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^n \p(E|B_j) \cdot \p(B_j)}
&& \text{Use General Law of Total Probability for $\p(E)$} \\
\end{align}
$$


<h2>Unknown Normalization Constant</h2>

<p>There are times when we would like to use Bayes' Theorem to update a belief, but we don't know the probability of $E$, $\p(E)$. All hope is not lost. This term is called the "normalization constant" because it is the same regardless of whether or not the event $B$ happens. The solution that we used above was the law of total probability: $\p(E) = \p(E |B) \p(B) + \p(E|B\c)\p(B\c)$. This allows us to calculate $\p(E)$.</p>




<p>
	Here is another strategy for dealing with an unknown $\p(E)$. We can make it cancel out by calculating the ratio of $\frac{\p(B|E)}{\p(B\c|E)}$. This fraction tells you how many times more likely it is that $B$ will happen given $E$ than not $B$:
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\p(B|E)}{\p(B\c|E)} 
&= \frac{
	\frac{\p(E|B)\p(B)}{\p(E)}
}{
	\frac{\p(E|B\c)\p(B\c)}{\p(E)}
}
&& \text{Apply Bayes' Theorem to both terms} \\
&= \frac{
	\p(E|B)\p(B)
}{
	\p(E|B\c)\p(B\c)
}
&& \text{The term $\p(E)$ cancels}
\end{align}
$$
	</p>

	<!-- <p>
We can always use the fact that either $B$ will happen or it won't when consistently conditioned on $E$:  $\p(B |E) + \p(B\c|E) =1$ to compute $\p(E)$. Note that this is the simply the <a href="{{pathToLang}}part1/cond_prob/#cond_paradigm">first identity of probability</a>, consistently conditioning:
$$
\begin{align}
1 &= \p(B|E) + \p(B\c|E) 
&& \text{Either $B$ occurs or it doesn't} \\

1 &= \frac{\p(E|B)\p(B)}{\p(E)}
 + 
\frac{\p(E|B\c)\p(B\c)}{\p(E)}
&& \text{Apply Bayes' Theorem to both terms}
\\

1 &= \frac{1}{\p(E)} \cdot \big[\p(E|B)\p(B) + \p(E|B\c)\p(B\c)\big]
&& \text{Factor out $1/ \p(E)$} \\

\p(E) &= \p(E|B)\p(B) + \p(E|B\c)\p(B\c)
&& \text{Rearrange terms}
\end{align}
$$
If you look closely at the last line, you will notice that we have simply found a new way to derive the total law of probability for $E$. The law of total probability is truly a great way of dealing with $\p(E)$. -->

	$$
	\begin{align}
	\p(B | E) &\propto \p(E|B)\p(B) \\

	\end{align}
